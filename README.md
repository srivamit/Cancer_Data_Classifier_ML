# Breast Cancer Classification with Logistic Regression

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for classifying breast cancer as either malignant or benign. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn. The project involves loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training a logistic regression model, evaluating the model, and making predictions on new data.

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is used in this project. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
